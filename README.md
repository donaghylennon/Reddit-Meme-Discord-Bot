# Reddit-Meme-Discord-Bot
Discord bot that retrieves memes from Reddit and posts them on a channel in a Discord server

If you want to use yourself, you will need to look into the reddit and discord APIs for your
own keys and such. This is designed to be run on a personal server so my code retrieves this
info from environment variables to keep them out of the code (and private).
